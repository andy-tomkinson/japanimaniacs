We have spent most of our day (or days) in 3 planes and airports.
The stop in Bangkok has been longer than the one in Doha. 
By this point our eyes are bloodshot and our bodies in automated mode. 
And we have to check-in between flights and go through internal transfer security.
I pick the wrong colour for my shoe tray and get a bit yelled at. 
That will teach me, it's pink not green, ok?

My skin is getting itchy, so we try to find some neutral smelling Nivea.
We end up getting a foul "man" smelling one. 
You should see Andy's face every time I use it...

All beauty products seem to include the word "white" as a selling point. Maybe like our "anti-ageing".
In our part of the world, most people don't look like babies, and in this part of the world, most people are not white. QED.
We have to downgrade our toothpaste tube for some reason of having to repackage it otherwise.
The world is a strange place, airports stranger still.

We share a matcha milk tea and 2 very dry onigiris. I wince when taking my first gulp of the tea.
It's ... different.

The last flight with ANA airline is by far the most pleasant. 
There is more leg room for one thing and it's so so very quiet – relatively to the previous flight but also regardless. 
No increasingly drunken Russian speaking guys kicking in our seats and being merry.
No loud German speaking couple sitting in the front.
What I mean to say is the Bangkok to Tokyo flight is heaven (and it has icecream!)

As we take off, the ground staff I can see from my window stand in a line and wave the plane goodbye.

The air hostess is very caring. We sleep on and off and every time we wake up, she tends to us.
The last time we wake up before landing, she greets us with a smily "Good morning!" (it's 6pm in Japan by that point) and offers us one last coffee.

We land in Haneda, breeze through security to find the JR (Japan Rails) centre very easily.
It's fully decorated with cute stickers of characters and flags. 
We hand over the passports to retrieve the train passes. 
The assistant then proceeds to show us the ground rules for using the pass. 
From the French brochure.
By the time we leave, she has told us that the starting date for the pass cannot be amended 4 times.

We get to the monorail, which is the sort of train that could connect a French or English big city to its smaller immediate counterparts. Like an extension of the tube.
It's quite rickety and charmingly outdated. 
Outside, a rain storm is raging. 
I think about whether we will be able to have a walk tonight. 
It's 7pm local time when we arrive at Shimbasi station.
There, we have to switch for the metro. 
We find numerous fare adjustment machines for the SUICA (a top-up card system). 
Turns out it's sold at JR centres. Oh well.

We go in circles looking for a ticket-selling machine or desk. To no avail.
I spot a young lady texting and with much apologizing I ask whether she speaks any English.

Apologetically, she says no but she obviously wants to help regardless and urges me to speak more.
I vaguely remember the word "kippu", so I make a gesture and say "buy kippu/buy ticket".
She reacts and repeats "kippu" which seems like a good sign. She then waves us to follow her.
For the next ten minutes, we meander with her through the station.
It's very confusing as she stops and talks to metro employees.
We already know our JR passes are not valid on the metro.
We eventually get to a machine to find out it's cash only. 
Our gentle help takes her leave, we must have said "arigato gozaimas" at least 10 times between us.

We stop at Akasaka-mitsuke and walk for 15 minutes in the rain to get to our APA hotel.
It is a big Japanese hotel chain.

We get to our room, wonder at our very own toilets, take a shower, dump our bags and head back outside.
We are staying near the Imperial Palace.

It's 9:20pm and a party of guards looks like they are searching for something on the other side of the moat.
We wander down as runners and bikes go past us. 
It's no longer pouring down. One of the kids running is wearing five fingers !!!
The smells are rich and heavy with mint combined with other unknown but fragrant plants. 
We spot a cat or a fox or some other small carnivorous mammal and a heron in the dark.
We only get so far down before going back – we are very tired.


We stop at a food place where we pick some containers filled with funny looking food.
The employee greets us with an enthusiasm I could never match at almost 11pm.
She does not have to handle change or payments, there is a machine at the counter for that!

We eat some eggs, aubergines (which look like fish) and meatballs before falling asleep in a blink. 

Andy's highlight of the day: Toilet slippers.
