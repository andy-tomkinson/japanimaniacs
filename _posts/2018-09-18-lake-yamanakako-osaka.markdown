19/09/2018

Before falling asleep, we had devised two plans. 

![brekkie1]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File20.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Plan A:
* wake up at 6:30
* enjoy the onsen (open from 7am)
* breakfast at 8 (scheduled time for it – as a ryokan is a bit like a BnB only with set times)
* walk to the end of the lake to catch a glimpse of Fuji.

Plan B – if for some reason we are up before 6:30:
* go for the walk first
* proceed with the rest.

Andy woke up around 4am, we ended up starting the walk at 5:30 am. 
Clouds laid heavily on the mountain tops across the lake.
It did not bode well.

Long story short, after a pleasant 40 min * 2 walk, we still only had seen Fuji in pictures.
We headed back and followed through with the onsen and breakfast.

Caramelised fish + nuts, soup, pan-fried salmon, some black veg or algae, a salad (lettuce tomato kiwi), roe wrapped fish, a steamed pot of mushrooms, bean sprouts, 1 pork sausage and soy.
The lady host (and cook) points to the soup authoritavely as she pours a very vinegary soy sauce in the bowl for me to scoop the soup into.
We leave our hosts to get back to the station for Osaka!

We end up travelling for 5 hours 30... 

Only notable is our bus ride is made slightly more comfortable by the fact we are sat sideways and have a bit more hip space. An American guy is sat on 1 priory seat with his bag on another.
I spend most of the ride silently cursing him given the number of elderly that got on the bus.
There is a board above the windshield which we assume indicates fares by zone. 
The numbers change as we advance in our journey. 
There is almost non-stop automated talking ending with "kudasai" or "gozeimas". 
Coupled with the driver making announcements, it's very noisy at the best of times.

At Gotemba station, a tidy row of kids in uniforms is sat on the floor in front of the ticket desk.
They wear matching yellow backpacks and red caps.
On the platform, from a group of 6 or 7 yo in high spirits, a young kid hails us with a "Hello Japanese!".
Amused, we reply in the same fashion. He gets hushed by a grand father like figure. THEY ARE SO CUTE.
Please note, I did not take a picture of these kids. 
I want to be granted entrance again some day in the future thanks.

Osaka ends up being only 4 train changes away.
It's our first ride on the Shinkansen (ie the bullet train, it can go up to 320 km/h or 200 mph).

We agree on walking to the hotel being quite sick of transport. 
It's located in the business district of Osaka and big towers sprawl front and back.

We have read Osaka is considered the rudest of Japanese cities.
The hotel clerk is curt, Andy – who has very early on remarked that politeness requires handing things with 2 hands – remarks that she only uses one hand!
Our room is similar if slightly larger than in Tokyo. After a blessed shower, we dive back in the heat.
Our next quest is food and the hip [Amerika-mura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerikamura).
This 40 min walk is fascinating. Osaka is buzzing. 
Bikes zoom past on the pavement we share with them.
People hurry past. 

Our grand plan is to try the famous octopus dough balls (tako-yaki) in a guide-recommended street-food place.
It's closed or shut.

Around us, coloured hair, well-defined polished styles, funky shops.
We spot a few love hotels with adult entertainment.

And finally find a place which seems to do fried skewers (kushikatsu) AND octoballs. Yey!

![brekkie2]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File25.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I order the balls, Andy a set of 10 skewers. One detail, it's "Make your own octoballs".
I am so helpless that Andy takes over then the waiter. The second set is done by the waiter and then the waitress.
It's that hard.
A hot mould complete with a gas bottle (health and safety anyone?):
* grease it with an oil brush
* plant the octopus pieces in each ball
* turn the balls around with dedicated skewers
* cover in mayo, soy sauce, onion flakes and parsley
* enjoy!

The veg and meat skewers are nice too. The dipping sauce is shared, so __no double dipping__.
I have a plum liqueur, Andy a beer.

J-pop is blaring and opposite us on the TV, among some incomprehensible videos, Bernadette Chirac in a bakery somewhere in Japan. Yep.

Well fed, we are ready to take on Dotonbori. It's huge, silly huge.
It's packed with gaming/gambling places, filled with mostly boys or men playing.

![brekkie2]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File28.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Selfies taker are amassed in front of the running man.
We walk for what feels like an eternity and decide that we can't conquer it all in one night.

On the way back to the hotel, we do a pit stop at the Beer Belly. It's Minoh's beer dedicated pub.
We have a few pints and some. Our favourite is the Peach Weizen. 
We talk a lot together and to some __really__ drunk Japanese guys. One keeps punching the other really hard. 
They are having chips with vinegar. 
Only with chopsticks. I resist the urge to take a picture on the sly.

We go to bed drunk and with very aching feet.
