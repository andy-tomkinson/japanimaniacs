We get up at 8, have a shower and head down for our first Japanese breakfast!

I have high fish expectations. 

As we get in, my excited greeting to the waitress is met with cold indifference.

I am actually surprised and by no means deterred. 
The buffet turns out to be very average, even though we do try strange food.

I fail to help myself to some yuba (ie soy skin).
Frankly it's like helping yourself to milk skin with chopsticks. 
Setting yourself up for failure. Do try at home and let me know how it goes.

There is a gooey mix of very finely chopped veg, one harumaki each (filled pastry roll), some fried meatballs, some steamed meatballs. 

There is some mackerel too but on the Western side of things (???).
I end up taking "some" of the mackerel.

Andy splits more evenly between Western and Asian.

On the wall, we can read some cuisine (and also un)related quotes in English. 
Including a drawing of an egg shell being broken with "Egg York" as a caption.

Our breakfasts down, we pack our bags and leave for Yamanaka-ko. We walk around the Imperial Palace.
It's warm. The sun is blazing, we try our best to stay in the shade.
We come across some extreme gardeners in climbing gear tending to the vegetation on our side of the moat.

The outside ring of the palace offers a nice pedestrian walk where a lot of people run (like last night but more).
It's also sat directly next to some pretty busy and huge roads. 
One side is very quiet, full of chirping birds, the other is hell.

We reach Tokyo station where we jump on the Tokaido line, next stop Kozu.
Kozu station boasts a sea view and some pretty mean vending machines (ICECREAM again!!!).

This is when I realise you can also use your SUICA (ie the metro top up card) to pay for these.
I have some coins (500, 100, 10, 1 and one unknown with a hole in it). 
So I get a fresh lemon drink to share. Still very warm outside.

We get on the train but are no longer sure it's the right one. 
I ask two lovely ladies who after some time on their phone, reply "hai hai" and show us the estimated arrival time.
When they leave the train, they bow to us (and we do too). 
We can see more and more mountains as we travel South. 
The vegetation becomes more luxuriant.

In Gotemba, we get bus tickets and enjoy the most uncomfortable bus ride I have ever been on - I think.
Seats are tiny, we feel like giants squeezed against each other.

The entrance is by the middle door and you show your tickets or pass or pay at the end. Funny.
A short walk gets us to the ryokan (ie a traditional guesthouse). 
There we don some indoors slippers and I almost immediately try a massage chair in a corner.

Our lady host shows us to our room. It's fantastic. 
Tatami mats are just great.
We have a handy guide to put on our yukata robes (ie very comfy cotton robes) and obi belts.

Once dressed, and after having some tea, we head to the onsen.

We first wash on the side and rinse, leaving everything behind. 
Everything in your hair or your body. I mean it. Everything.

The water is extremely hot (please note I am a fan of hot baths â€“ this was very hot for me).
The man host who showed us the bath room had told us to stir the cold water with a device.
Well, I am afraid there was no such thing as cold water. Andy takes it in stride, I struggle.
Again, amazing, but really hot. I alternate between cold showers and going back in the bath.

We are both quite light-headed and soft as whipped butter by the end of it.
Once back in our room, Andy falls asleep on the floor with no bedding (bedding is installed while we eat dinner).
That kind of relaxed.

At 6:15pm, we have tea/dinner/supper (ie the last meal of the day). There is so.much.food.
We are given some grape juice and white wine, a [sweet fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayu) each, which you're supposed to eat from head to tail, tempura, a fish soup, a filled bun that looks and tastes a bit like mash. A lot of food.

Finishing up is hard and we just skip the rice (we only figured out the rice bit towards the end anyway).
Honestly too much food. We try the massage chair again and have a walk around the koi pond in garden slippers.

To bed now, see you tomorrow Mount Fuji!

Andy's highlight: Sweating and soaking in the onsen
