20/09/2018

We get up at 10:30 am.
It takes the yet gentle but insistent knock of the cleaning staff to realise we have not put up a "Do Not Disturb" on the handle or as it turns out a magnet on the door. 

We enjoy a quick breakfast at one of the station's cafés. 
I go for an impenetrable looking sandwich, Andy for a cheese and bacon pastry. 
My mysterious food is in fact a sweet chilli shrimp cutlet sandwich. It's tasty.

Apart from Andy's find, I have not seen cheese in days. 

We have looked up what a typical Japanese breakfast could be:

* miso or corn soup
* fruit
* some pickles
* some egg things
* some fish things

It's not obvious where you can find a typical breakfast in Osaka on our way to the station.
More on that later.

We are ready for Nara and for a rainy day! It rains in Osaka and it rains in Nara.
The town itself is very charming. 
It offers touristy shops on your way to the park but also various traditional shops promoting art and local produce. Notably a sake bar which will be closed when we try it later.

Nara's park spreads over 16 hectares composed of shrines, temples and grazing space.
One of the main attractions greets us in town before even reaching the park.

Deer and bucks are resting on green patches marking our way towards the entrance.
A few gracefully deign look at us before heading back to their business.
Right by the entrance, stands a temple, a shrine and the country's second tallest (only by a few centimetres apparently) pagoda.

![pagoda]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File40.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

What is inside a pagoda though?!

The shrine is erected to one of the disciples of Buddah, only the English description is identical to the one we will read later under a different disciple. 
Go figure.

You can rub the matching body part on your and his body and you will feel better the caption says (something like that). I rub my feet something bad. Constant walking has taken its toll. Andy rubs his wrist.

We skip visiting the temple for a fee. Most of their adorned complexity is lost on us uncouth heathens.
We do however splurge on rice crackers. 
Some sellers advertise in English, some don't but if you see 150円, you know you're in for some good stuff.

There is a queue as the owners have vanished inside. A queue of humans and deer.
A buck starts headbutting a girl as soon as she gets some crackers.
One of the owners empties a bucket of water to clean out the poop in front. 
Picturesque.
I ask for 2 stacks but as a matter of fact as is often the case in our limited experience, it's pay first, speak later. So once I had put down 300, the rest was pretty obvious.
I start getting headbutted too, pinched and lightly bitten. All in good humour.
Andy gets the second stack to have his fun too. Slobbered over and butt pinched too.

We stumble upon another shrine where you can make an offer to play court music to the gods.
By the entrance, a fountain with small bamboo ladels to wash your hands and mouth with (do no let any of your water drip back in the fountain).

A man pays an offer as we pry on him as discreetly as we can (ie not very).
He pulls a rope attached to a bell, sing-songs something, loudly claps three times and bows.
It's quite short.

As he turns, I turn and pretend to read something (in English).
Some ice has been offered to grant ice sellers hotter summers.

I may have forgotten to mention the pouring rain. 
We are absolutely drenched by the time we reach the [Daibutsu-den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji).
From buses, pour down throngs of students and tourists probably out on a day trip.

Teens have a good time teasing any of their friends feeding the animals.
We reach gates guarded on either side by wooden guards. Not just your average gate, or your average guard.

![guard]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File38.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Pretty scary stuff. A mere forewarming of the awe to come.

Once inside the temple, we truly have been cleansed by the rain.
In all its splendor, the Buddah Vairocana grandly ignores all mere mortals gathered at its feet like tiny ants.

![guard]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File37.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

This complex with all its grandeur is said to have brought the country on the brink of economic collapse. 
Yep, we believe that. He used to be entirely gilded.
His head is surrounded by his 16 manifestations scaled to look at the same size to the ants.
You don't need a lot of background to be impressed by the whole thing.

We then take shelter in a café from where we spot ladies in great attire.

![ladies]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File36.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We have also decided this morning to bump our exoticism a notch by wearing waterproofs when everyone else is carrying umbrellas.

Rain has finally broken our spirit. On the way home, I acquire some cute deer-related tourist tat and we get some postcards. Back at the hotel, 70% dry as Andy would put it, we get drier. 

Hot chocolates count of the day: 3.

Andy is tasked with choosing our dinner venue. It is a quest. 
He finds two very close and highly recommended ramen places.
We start with the furthest.
There is a queue outside and a machine.
I ask with an apology if they are waiting to get in. 
After a doubtful exchange, and not really knowing what we are supposed to do, we decide to chance the closest.

Only on the way, I try a place packed with locals only to be met with rejection. 
The language barrier feels pretty high and electrified. I am way out of my comfort zone.

At the closest ramen place, there is a queue (smaller) and a machine. Again! This time, the owner third-explains the deal. Thank Buddha.

* choose on the menu
* go to the machine
* pay first
* press buttons 
* get ticket
* get back outside

If you're too slow, it times out. We're slow.
We only recognise our dishes by prices.

We are eventually ushered in, handed over our bowls.
We thought we needed toppings but actually the bowls are enough (they have a topping already).

Noobs. We still enjoy our extra toppings and 6 giozas. It's delish.

![buck]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File44.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We slurp the noodles like the next Osakian. 
By which I mean, I check out the guy next to Andy to make sure we do. 
I hope he is Osakian.

The soft-boiled egg is particularly nice. It's cheap, intense and cool.

I am glad Andy pushed me through. We top up the evening with 2 halves at the Beer Belly next door.

And off to bed. 

Andy's highlight: Being eaten by deer
