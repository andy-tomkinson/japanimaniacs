Sleeping is hard. 
We are still out of sync and crankier than the usual (yes, I assure you).
Last night, I drifted in and out to give up after a while.
I squint my eyes in the dark and read the clock. WAIT, 2:08?
I wake up Andy for confirmation. Yes, it is 2:08pm.

We head for a mid-afternoon walk around Kyoto. Hmm.

At Osaka's main station, we try another "breakfast" place with a gent somehow dressed as a butler ushering us in.
The menu may be geared towards Westerners. It's hard to tell.
Around us, I can't see any of our lot. The prices are a bit higher for the same items.
My gold standard: the shrimp cutlet sandwich. 

They do fancy coffee, you can choose the roast and brew type.
I don't know how we do tea but I suspect poorly because I have yet to drink decent coffee here.

The rest of the pictures on the menu are *not* appetizing. 
It's like a mash-up of western dishes, some with a Japanese take on them. 
We just go for French toast and jam. A toast as thick as three slices. 
I ponder at the state of their air-con (it's grim). I am not exactly feeling the love.

We arrive in Kyoto after a 30 min (maybe) journey mostly stood up. 
Exiting, we find ourselves facing Kyoto's tower.

So because I am not really an expert at all I was surprised to learn that old-styled houses (machiya) are actually far and few between and knowing a bit of a revival.
Kyoto has for most part a fairly modern side to it.

We reach Higashi Honganji 8 minutes before it closes (like most things in the UK, sight-seeing buildings close at 5pm).
A bit of push given the apparent immensity of the structure. Clearly a tomorrow's job.

For now, we are happy walking through narrow streets bordered by modern and more traditional houses. We flirt dangerously with cars, curb is clearly optional in Kyoto.

Our destination: Gion, the entertainment center where geisha-spotting is a sport.
Dusk makes our visit even more bucolic. Sadly, my camera does not handle low-lit scenes really well at all (ie not at all). The whole scene is lit by lanterns.

![other_piglet]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File52.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We start our tour of Gion at Yasaka-jinja, the guardian shrine of Gion. 
There we spot what we think are either maikos (apprentice geiko/geisha) or thematically dressed teens.

By the entrance, some street food sellers offer their goods (for a fee) with a no-photo sign up.
We share a doughy lightly cheesy skewer (turns out to be Hashimaki, mountain yam and yuba) that we eat on the side, not on the move. I am not sure about eating on the move but drinking on the move is definitely considered impolite. Andy spotted a few exceptions to the rule but on the whole no one does it (including us).
Earlier we shared a honey lemon sparkling small drink from one of the vending machines in a silent and immobile communion (or so). 

The inner yard of the temple is eerie. It's quite crowded despite the advancing hour. The lantern and crickets/cicadas's song enhance the poetry of the place.

The high street is roof-covered on each side and we are glad because... it's raining again! We give in to peer pressure and get an umbrella like 99.9% of the population. Each side of the street is also adorned with lanterns.

It's a very quaint sight. Strolling by Shirakawa canal is equally enchanting, especially when after having discussed sake tasting we stumble upon a hostel bar (?) doing sake tasting. The waiter is very polite and really quite nice to us. We choose a set from the Kyoto region and one from Nigiita. He explains the strength and flavours of each as well as their origin by our geographical knowledge is lacking (especially mine). They are between 16 and 17 percent, we proceed with caution. One is floral, one is fruity, one champagn-y, none tastes like any of the sakes we have had in the UK or in France. The bottles are 1.8l.

A regular enters and starts creating a wave of "Hoooo" in a given diameter around him.
If you've been to a pub before, you have met this guy. He is showing off something that from where we are sitting looks like a chopstick holder. But it doesn't add up. We ask the waiter. It's a gold souvenir from India to decorate cups (?). As we settle the bill, the waiter jokes about the number of coins and vending machines in his country. We can only agree. We depart merrily. 

Walking by the river Kamogawa can whet your appetite. A long stretch of restaurants are inacessible to foreigners without a Japanese friend (says the guide). 

Ponto-chō is a long strip of bars, restaurants and single men places (maid cafés, etc).
It's not the first time we notice that a variety of places (food stands, pharmacies, restaurants, shops) have dedicated touts __singing__ to the passers-by. In terms of music, some green lights, train and tube stops have tunes. Other lights just go "meep. meep.", when they stop, time to hurry. Many Osakians dash for green lights, not a lot jaywalk.

And that's when the magic happens. It must be the end of dinner time when we go past some charming and super expensive looking restaurants. As a party of patrons take their leave, they are escorted by restaurant staff and giggling geikos.

We have caught sight of our first full-on white make-up geiko! We see a few others after that.
We feel elated.
It's time for us to go home with the pride of a job well done.
Our calves, feet and one knee are missing in action. 
We have set our mind on the food option we have not tried yet. The corner shop!
7/11 and Family Marts sell ready-made fresh food. We get our hands on what is available for the soup and 2 sets of skewers.
1 set is just chicken skin, the other fried chicken - turns out.

The soup has:
* herby minced meatballs
* boiled meat skewers
* something quite strange (still have no idea)
* 2 soft boiled eggs
* one veg

And to bed, with an alarm set for 7 am tomorrow.

Andy's highlight of the afternoon: sneaky geisha-spotting
