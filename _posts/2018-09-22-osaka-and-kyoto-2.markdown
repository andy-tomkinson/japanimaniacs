22/09/2018

The alarm goes off at 7 am. Now that's more like it. 

On our way to the station, we stop at a Western-style cafeteria and have a small sandwich each.
No coffee because the waiter did not understand me and it's not worth fighting for anyway.
I forsake my right to be caffeinated.

We smoothly hop on a train to Kyoto.

I don't know if it's because we are going to very touristic destinations but trains are frequent and on time.
The Shinkansen (ie bullet train) is a step up from English trains, the non-Shinkansen a step down – Andy reflects.

I was not blown away by the Shinkansen. It's as good as the TGV (minus the delays).
Plus because the fast lines are completely isolated from the regular ones, you always end up having to change to connect to a city. 
One fun thing about the seat backs on local trains, which we discover a day later, is that you can grab them by pairs (not to be confused with "by the pussy") and change their orientations. Genius.

Today after so much sight-seeing, we are feeling the wounds that plague tourists. Andy has a weakening knee and my soles are almost constantly on fire. Fun times.

Kyoto. Same players, play again.

The station exit is swarming with tourists.
We have been redirected twice to the bus terminal – it's that obvious – to get a day pass.
One of the temples located 3km North of Kyoto is only accessible by bus.
We give up on the idea of visiting it when we see the line of people queueing for the bus while an agent is shouting in a megaphone in Japanese to keep it in order. No. Thank you.
I struggle keeping Andy from joining the queue*.

*this fact might not be entirely accurate.


We change trains to get to [Fushimi Inari-taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha). The weather is very muggy. Convenient since the backpack is somehow glued to one of our backs while the plastic umbrella is to the other person's arm. Sexy.

![selfie]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File79.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The entrance is as packed as Kyoto's station.
This once we have so many available examples of how to use the cleansing fountain that we cannot get it wrong.
Andy spots in disgust two foreign examples who did not bother reading the signs surrounding us or watching people opposite them and just let the water from their hands and mouth fall back in the common fountain. Lovely.

![disgust]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File61.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We pass the torii gates only to meet... more gates (10,000 total). All of them orange.

![disgust]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File62.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Unfortunately we are not enlightened. I think it's something to do with the crowd, the weather and not being a Japanese monk. Regrettable.

![disgust]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File64.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Various shrines are met along the way where people make offers, ring the bell and clap their hands.

You can go up to the top of the hill and meet more shrines and more gates. And be more enlightened (* offer only applies if you're a monk).

We stop half-way. The whole temple is surrounded by bamboo trees and the type of vegetation that flourish in a rather dark, wet and warm enviromnent.

![vegetation]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File63.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Once outside the temple, we spot a flock a street food sellers who I guess are permanently there because of the number of tourists. Some of their treats are supposed to only be sold during festival times. But good for us I suppose. We get our sticky hands on a [dango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dango){:target="_blank"}. It's marshmallowy yummy!

Back to Kyoto's station, we buy a day ticket out of convenience as single tickets work by zone fares and it's not that convenient to work out. 

Starting with the closing temple from the previous day, we now have time to explore in socks the magnificent structure made of dark wood (which wood?). I forgot to mention the smells. When passing near bamboo sliding doors or at this temple, the wood is unmistakably scented. Even incensed in the present case.

![temple]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File66.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We lose a postcard I have just finished writing which delays us just enough to catch a wedding happening.
The bride and groom are wearing highly elegant and presumably traditional attires.

![wedding]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File67.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Some of the attending party are also clad in rich-looking wonderfully coloured kimonos.
We watch for a bit with wonder and take a few snaps but it feels a bit rude so we move on.

The next room is as intricately adorned as the main hall. Golden suspensions, wooden reliefs, it is probably something along the lines of marrying in the Minster (or any other cathedral for that matter). 

![wedding]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File68.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

With our shoes back on, we walk to the "nearest" metro station. Which turns out to be quite far away.
We come to the realisation that the metro network in Kyoto is quite small and our day ticket (provided you do not use the bus) – overrated. 

We stop for a drink (a good old Coca-Cola) at a vending machine. We are simply melting. 
The street is empty. I sit back to the wall of a building and like Eve, Psyche or Pandora before me, offer Andy a sit on the small step directly against the wall to and not blocking any passage way while we sip a can of Coke between us. People walk past.
A lady with a gauze mask walks past us ladden with a huge load of plastic bags. She stares at us.
She walks around a second time this time confirming she is coming for us rowdy teenagers.
She makes various gestures as she says "Sorry". We look in puzzlement and shrug further indicating our puzzlement.

We look around and see nothing until she brings us to the corner entrance of the ryokan opposite us and points at an A4 sign on the wall. Let's recap:
* we should have known not to drink by the wall by the vending machine because of a sign on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'. Fair.

It's lunch time and we are set on trying Kobe beef (or grade A beef that you should totally ask Andy more details about). Andy has bookmarked a place that offers affordable lunch menu. The offers are even more remarkably affordable as the place only ever opens for dinner. We despair a bit and decide to play it by ear.

On the same street a sign entirely in Japanese except for "All 900 円" gets our attention. 
At the end of a back alley behind some rusty emergency stairs, where some boxes of vegetable are waiting to be picked up. Now, that's the one.

![backalley]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File73.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We are asked by sign mostly to wait for 5 minutes. Sat at a counter encircling the kitchen, not unlike the ramen place. No gaijin (foreigners) but us. Win. 

They fill in trays with a bowl of tofu topped up with soy sauce, a bowl of rice, some pickled takuan (a sort of radish I had to google), a soup and whatever set you chose from the menu.

![trays]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File69.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

After two very confusing exchanges, Andy goes for chicken, I go for grilled fish the only options left.
Popular.

![fish]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File70.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

![chicken]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File71.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The cook grills everything on a giant barbecue above which hangs a dry chicken carcass.
We enjoy this hearty and tasty meal. Andy repays the chef with a "gochisō-sama deshita".
They look happy, we look happy. Everything is great.

We walk back to the station bound for the Imperial Palace.
We totally completely accidentally enter a bookshop with "English books available".
I fall for a manga about Isabella Bird in English and Japanese.

Andy for a book we think might be similar to "Watching the English", called "The Xenophobic guide to the Japanese" with more of a humourous take.

We get to the Imperial Palace, walk around 2/3 of it, can't find the entrance, find another entrance that states "fully booked for the day", give my feet a rest, give the first structure left-over third a go.

![palace]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File74.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

 Bam. We're in 7 minutes before last admittance. 

 We walk around the beautiful palace. According to the descriptions, almost every room was used for rituals.

 Three waiting rooms are glass-walled and painted respectively with cherry trees, cranes and tigers.
 The mats are edged in harmony with the walls. It's sumptuous.

 ![palace]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File75.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

 The order of nobility dictates where you wait. If waiting in the cherry tree room, you could not use the coach porch and had to use the stepping stone to remind you that your ascendance sucked.

 The parting walls between halls are delicately painted.

 ![walls]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File76.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

After the visit of this architectural masterwork, we agree that an icecream would be in order.
When would it not?

Behind a short cotton sign, we slide a door to heaven. First, we sit, second, we are handed a set of rules. 
Andy reminds me everything comes with rules here. Nyan nyan nyan.

I go for a berry cup, Andy for the nihon cup. Both of us have a matcha flavoured ball and a buckwheat cookie ball.
A small teapot each – see rule #1001, we are an icecream shop not a café, you cannot change your tea for a coffee.

 ![icecream]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File78.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

With hindsight, biking might be the best way to visit Kyoto. All the main sites are far from each other and the metro network isn't large enough.

On our walk back, we spot more geikos. It seems Kyoto is the place Japanese people (especially teens) like to visit dressed traditionally. This makes the human tid slightly more tolerable. 
Kyoto on a cold, rainy weekday might be ideal for us actually.

Back in Osaka, no food, we are exhausted.

Andy's highlight: Orange gates and dango.
