Today is "rest day". Sunday. A day not to walk like maniacs, a day to just chill.

Andy has searched for good breakfast places on the interweb and found one beyond the station.
For the first time, we walk past the central station or should I stay [stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Csaka_Station){:target="_blank"}.

![hotel]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File77.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

"Osaka Station and Umeda Station, effectively part of the same complex, together constitute the busiest station in Western Japan, serving 2,343,727 passengers daily in 2005, and the fourth-busiest railway station in the world."

It hits us that this huge maze is weaved from different train stations, metro station and malls. 
As a sidenote, there are a few private rail companies run by malls. It's mental.

Where a mall ends another begins overground, underground, you'd better start on buying.

We enter a corporate-looking building, get up to the second floor (1st for France) where a comfy square leather sofa is conveniently located by a series of conference rooms to wait for our interview. Err, we also find the honolulu-themed place we were looking for.

Upon entering and especially upon exiting a food venue, you are warmly greeted by the staff.
This place is no exception. Teriyaki chicken, potatoes and eggs for me. A thick strip of bacon, eggs, and a mini hill of whipped cream with pancakes. The table next to ours has ordered a mountain!

We devour it. The waiting staff offers any new-comers with a camera a chance to take a pic of them. Say "hai"!

We are ready to take on [Himeji Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himeji_Castle){:target="_blank"} and its gardens.

Local + Shinkansen bound for Hiroshima = Tchootchoo.

We exit the station. Even I cannot get lost. On a hill, in the distance, the white castle awaits us.

![castle]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File83.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Built in the 14th century, it has changed hands 48 times (or so). Long story.

We walk through the long avenue stretching to its feet. I notice the sewer plaques, we will spot different ones in Osaka that night.

![sewers]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File84.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Upon crossing the moat, we hear a resounding and cheerful "hello!". It's the old man holding a bike to my right while smiling at us. Surprised, we reply "Hello, how are you?".
The man replies "No, no English". Right. He then mumbles "Europea?". We nod and enthusiastically add "English, ēgo". He seems pleased, we are pleased too.

Andy has been feeding me cultural snippets from the book bought the day before.

Tickets in hand, we enter the fortress. 

With all its beauty, this place is a deadly trap for assaillants.

You have to pass multiple gates on your way up, some hidden from sight. 
The walls have arrow slits to shoot you from all sides.

![loopholes]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File86.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Inside, everybody take off their shoes to visit. Gliding in socks through this building is delightful.
The place is packed.

If you were looking to buy. On the plus side, the place has lots of weapon racks for your samurai friends' katanas and your own collection, a built-in shrine on the last floor. The rooms are a a bit dated, but nothing you could not live with. It also comes with handy holes for pouring boiling oil on burglars.

![oil]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File87.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We have to queue outside standing in the sun, we have to queue inside because of the sheer number of visitors.

While slowly making our way up, Andy treats me to a fictional – I hope – account of a castle attack complete with samurai duels. Despite the crowd, we still are very much amazed. 

![room]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File87_2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Once the castle is sock-conquered, we head to the gardens.

The guide had our hopes up with stories of samurai quarters but they are simply gardens.

Lovely gardens, complete with koi ponds, carefully pruned trees, butterflies, mosquitoes, the whole shebang.

They could be resting if the city noises did not invade the peace and quiet.

After an iced matcha and yozu juice, in a Starbucks at the station, Osaka warmly welcomes us again.

We decide it's time to use its metro for the first time in four days here.
It's not an easy task. The central station metro station is not geographically close to said station.
We get to our hotel appropriately named the "outside the station" APA hotel, fact-checker Andy discovers.

On this note, he also finds out that the first build on a street is number one, the second number two – regardless of their location making naming buildings pretty much a necessity and becoming a postman HARDCORE.

As we go out again, I snap a picture of this beauty, the umbrella brush:
![umbrella]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File92.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Also there is a gallery in the underground:

Back to Dotombari, we find our conveyor belt place in a huge building inside a packed arcade.

![dotombori]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File94.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The doors are heavy to push (which seems to be a thing here) and a whiff of cigarettes tickles our nostrils.
When we push the door, the manager announces last order at 10:30 pm. It's 10pm. Challenge accepted.

It's the dream. I didn't know it was but it actually is. We are given a number we find and sit.
We are faced with spices, a belt and a fountain of tea. 

![price]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File96.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We pick up cups and I pick up any plate coming my way (almost, favouring fish over anything else). Andy is more careful but equally enthralled. Every plate is 100円.

![price]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File95.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We binge.

15 minutes later:

25 plates later:

![plates]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File98.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We pay a grand total of £18 for 2. Last time we tried Yo sushi for a snack, we spent around £40/50.
I want to live here and I mean here in this venue.

The owner also gives a discount coupon as we leave. All for 95. Can you believe it?

We go out and catch a glimpse of a few street singers on our way back.

I am on cloud 9 (or 57). I feel like the manga trope of the keen eater, full of food.
Life is really excellent.
