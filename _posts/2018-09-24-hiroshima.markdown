"I will forever dream, simply as I did in my boyhood and therefore suffer only little"
Miekichi Suzuki

24/09

Today is transfer day. We move our quarters to Hiroshima for the next three days.

Once at Shin-Osaka station, Andy realises we have cheated by taking the more frequent NOMOZI line to Hima-ji castle the day before.

This time like good citizens we have to wait a bit longer to get a train on the Sakura line.

The queues are marked by tape on the floor. The train arrives, some cleaning happens inside. Even the lady waiting in front of me is getting impatient. So I am allowed too.

We finally get seats. I write our life away while Andy reads about the bombing of Hiroshima. There is always a few cars on the Shinkansen free of reservations. We have a seat but anyone on a later stop is not so lucky.

We arrive in Hiroshima an hour before check-in time. 

As we pull in the station, I notice a stadium full of people dressed in red.

We try checking in anyway. The clerk is the opposite of the one in Osaka. She is courteous, smiling, explains everything in details and makes us feel welcome. We drop our bags, leave our passports behind and head for the mall.

On our way, we notice a lot of passers-by or employees of various businesses are wearing the colour of the Carps, the local baseball team.

This mall is not meant for English speakers. We go up and up and up in search of an outdoors shop. The sales assistant knows a few words in English. There are many awkward moments in our conversation. She apologises, I apologise. Most sales can be tax free if you bring your passport. If you bring your passport. 

My favourite range of shoes:

We share a crunky bag to maintain our sugar levels (not crunchy, not chunky, CRUNKY)

* the monument to the mobilised students

Students as young as 12 were mobilised to contribute to the war effort.

* the monument to [Sadako Sasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki){:target="_blank"}

"She is remembered through the story of the one thousand origami cranes she folded before her death."
An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone who folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by the gods.

* the monument to the Korean victims

I won't go into details about what we thought or felt. 
It's a poignant testimony to what happened there.

On the way back to the hotel, we try to find a guide recommended food venue but if you have followed well till now, you know ahead of us that it is closed. And it is.

We find another small place with no English at all. It's Andy's turn to feel how I felt at the ramen place.

The waiter cannot be older than 19. He is very polite and terribly awkward. We don't speak Japanese and they do not speak English. The chef behind the hot plate greeting us as we enter could well be his father. We are sat at a hot plate table and handed hand towels (like everywhere we eat). If the waiter forgets that, it's kind of a big deal — as we have witnessed previously.

The menu we have to find by ourselves. It's sat next to us on the bench. On the table can be found a bowl of white fat, onion flakes, soy sauce, mayo and parsley. 

The menu has pictures and yes, it's convenient. I choose some okonomiyaki mix (cabbage pancake) and Andy some teppanyaki and rice. Every exchange with the waiter is an ordeal for both parties involved. It seems they want to apply the same standards to us so they desperately try and make us understand by speaking more Japanese. It's not working – for the record. We share our food. Hot plates are quite fun even though we have no idea what we are doing. The chef expertly handles more elaborate orders on the big hot plate.

The waitress looks at us either with despair or just staring into space. I ask whether we are doing anything wrong but quickly pedal back as she does not understand any English. 

My phone and camera drop on the floor and again she tries communicating by pointing at the floor once I have picked them up. I try handing my belongings, we try understanding, we fail.

She comes over and this time offers to take a picture of us. This gesture is universal. That's a nice touch.

The table next to us – two couples – are watching baseball as they eat and try joking around with the awkward waiter. No chance Alfonso. 

Eventually we ask for the bill with the proper sign – an X. 
This turns into a 10 minute struggle of blinking and thinking for the waitress who presents us (eventually) with a loyalty card. 

We thank them warmly and take our leave.
During the rest of the walk, we discuss using the hotel onsen. A gender-separated communal bath. I am curious but also anxious.
[I read this article of a guy who is also not much of a nudist](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/japan-onsen-guide/){:target="_blank"}

It cheers me up. Andy finally decides for a hot bath in the small but deep bathtub of our room. I take a deep breath and my courage and I go.

I wear a yukata, take a room key, a large towel, a small towel. 

Second floor, behind some cotton curtains and an automatic door. Once all belongings are left in the basket of the communal changing room, armed with the small towel, you move to the onsen room.

You wash on a small stool facing a mirror with some products, a shower head, a tab and a bucket. I choose a pacer. A lady who enters shortly after me. I wash for as long as she does. It has to be meticulous. I watch no one and no one looks at me. 

Once I am done, I square up the little towel on my head and get in the bath. It's less hot and more chlorinated than the ryokan's. There is however an outside bath hidden behind bamboo curtains. And a big single person boiling pot. That's the hottest.

It's relaxing but it's hard work. Meticulously washing with peer pressure. That bit is.

And off to bed.

Andy's highlight: The A-bomb dome.
