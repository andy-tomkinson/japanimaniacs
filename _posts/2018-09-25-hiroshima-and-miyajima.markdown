We get up at 8:30 am. By the time we ask reception about breakfast, it's 9:30am, the exact time at which the breakfast buffet closes. 

We grab something to eat at Tully's café– in the mall next to the station – along with two very creamy and very sweet vaguely caffeinated beverages.

The ride to Miyajima is eventless.
The short walk to the ferry port is made extremely easy by the signs and done mostly underground. It's one of our first trips where the concentration of foreigners is so high. 

We bravely and safely sails across the Seto inland sea with nobility or samurai rights. We know we will be able to go past the photogenic torii gate unlike common people who were only allowed as far as the gate.

We are on the wrong side to get a very close view of it as the ferry boat pulls in its dock.

On landing, a voice gives a warning about deer here being wild (as opposed to Nara). I mean...I guess it all depends on your definition of wild.

We sit in the shade for a minute to discuss THE plan. There are 7 wonders on the island, 4 of which are inacessible or dead (trees).

There is also a temple worshipping ogres I am not sure we saw on our way up.

![ogres]({{site.baseurl}}assets/ogres.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The group sat at a table next to us and eating cake gets the company of a very nosy and opinionated doe. Opinionated about cake sharing. It's funny to watch as no one gets hurt.

![deer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File111.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

More deer roam or stand in places where they probably get fed by locals and tourists. Some just enjoy the attention of all the amateur paparazzi.

![deer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File112.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The sea front promenade leading to the gate is lovely. It's like a UK seaside resort, only pretty and neither sordid nor dilapidated. Ok, maybe not entirely like a seaside resort.

Tourist shops abound. Including Itsukushima shrine at high tide.

![shrine]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File115.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

An old lady starts a very unusual day for us by saying "Hello". Then rides away on a scooter.

![lady]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File113.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

It's become a sort of tradition for me to buy a really touristy cap wherever I go.
And today with the sun trying to burn us down is a brilliant day for it. All the shops have but one stockist. So there is one model of cap being sold on this island. Still, it comes in 3 colours! The seller compliments me on my kawaii wallet bought in Nara. I cannot get over myself.

![caps]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File150.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

If you wonder what the symbol means, it means samurai. Yep. 
Such a relief when Andy translated it.

We go through a nice park complete with koi ponds and man-made waterfalls where we meet new friends.

![bug]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File116.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

![pond]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File145.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We buy a one way ticket to get 1 km from the highest point in the island. The circular line ride is pleasant. We fly above an ocean of green. So many dark shades and in the distance, the sea.
These cars can fit 6/8 people (what they mean is 6/8 small children).
The assistant only puts us and one poor Japanese guy in one.

![view]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File117.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

There was a ramp to get to this station.
But in the stairs between the circular and the funicular line, no such luxury. We see an old lady leaning heavily on her relatives and struggling. It's a mystery.

The funicular assistant heads us to get in a very full car. Very.full. I try not to panic. We are already extremely sweaty due to the heat and getting so close to people doesnt seem like a rich idea. But fear not, 3 more tall and wide Westerners are squeezed in after us. I try the zen approach but I am just begging for this to be over with. It's supposed to be a beautiful ride offering wonderful sea views. I see arms holding rails and play the game of don't touch the next person.

Andy spots our fellow traveller from before wiping a tear and praying to himself. He is having a worst time than me which strangely makes me feel better as I am not the only weirdo on board.

We get to a first view point next to the station.

![view]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File118.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
![view]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File119.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We start the walk to the top. On our steep way up, Andy meets Sarah:
- Have you seen any deer up here on this path?
- No up here I haven't
- But there was one before, I saw it and then it ran away!

Sarah must be 8 or 9 and is very excited about the deer!!!!

![statue]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File146.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We reach the lover's hole where a fire has been kept alive since the 9th century. 
We light a candle together (not from the ashes under the boiling pot of water).

![flame]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File120.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We drink, dry a bit, and proceed to the observatory. The view and breeze at the top are very welcome. There are many tourists there too. We cross the path of many a Japanese smartly dressed for the walk. 

![view]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File121.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Most of them greet us with a "Konnichiwa" which is highly unusual. We reply and even get so bold as to initiate contact!

One guy arrives at the top in flip flops and I am left wondering how he made it until we see him hopping barefoot like a mountain goat on the way down.

After resting, we decide to walk all the way down via the geology and animal path. 

![mushroom]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File122.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We meet a shirt and suit trousers man who greets us, asks for our nationality and lists some countries. Austria, New Zealand, Chigoku – sorry China, England, Ireland, Hungary... We think it's the nationalities he met on his way up but then adds "I travelled a lot" beaming with pride. I would be beaming too. His son (?) has an amused and patient face on. We part ways.

We find boulders and friable rocks and steps. All the steps. 

![dam]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File123.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

It's almost 2k of steps to get to the park. We have in mind to go to a swimming beach 2.8k away from the pier. 

Walking through the pier again, I make sure to have the specialty:
* grilled oysters (4 for me! What a surprise!)

![oysters]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File124.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* Andy tries a beer (What a surprise!).

![beer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File151.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We both have doughy stick (squid for me, bacon and cheese for Andy). Mostly doughy.

![stick]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File126.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We ease our minds by checking the last departure times for the ferry (11pm) and reach the beach. 
The walk is in a part of the island where tourists don't seem to go (except by shuttle bus to their hotel).

Rows of houses suceed to small buildings with an emergency shelter in between.

![emergency]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File148.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The walk is littered with deer poop.
From a distance, the beach is a jewel enclosed in a green frame.

![seafront]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File127.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

As we get closer, we see bits of polystherene flying/rolling on the sand, empty bottles, all sort of plastic garbage polluting the scenery, our thoughts and the mood.

![pollution]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File129.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We sit on the beach and I slowly swallow my disappointment. I am angry at the plastic waste we generate spoiling beautiful places like this. Japan with its numerous vending machines, single serving hand towels and cups, plastic wrapping plastic, is not innocent either. I glare at the block of polystherene floating on the water nearby. Can you spot it?

![spot_the_plastic]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File128.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

After resting we decide to try the Mihijima brewery on the pier. The woman at the beer stand promotes the number of beers available in the restaurant (30 minutes before her close time). We select one set each that we share.

![beer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File130.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

My favourite is again the weizen. I like them all but one, the more bourbony.

![beer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File131.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Andy's favourite is the Yozu.

Next to us, an American guy drowns a British couple with tales of his travels, "see when you're part of the music scene". While the girl seems genuinely interested, her partner goes for a break as we take our leave.

Watching the sun setting on the gate while sipping a tasty brew is not particularly disagreeable.

Ferrying by night has something magic. 
![ferry]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File132.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

On the local train back to Hiroshima, a baby girl in her dad's carrier is doing headflips to get glimpses of Andy and smiles delightfully at him while giggling. I am watching her. 
She does that periodically during the whole trip. 
Such a cutie! I mean Andy of course.

The Carp are playing again!
![carp]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File133.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

More magic awaits us tonight. Andy does not want to get his hopes up but he has found yet another place doing wagyu beef. Momonaki.

After a well-deserved and well-needed shower, we don whatever decent clean clothes we have. Finding the place is a bit trickier than expected.
 
We find a building with a plethora of signs but some are missing transliteration. We come to suspect a place based on the doubling of the first sign and vague remembrance of hiragana. We harpoon 2 passers-by for confirmation.

![momonaki]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File134.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We enter a small restaurant with 2/3 tables, a counter and no patrons. We are greeted and invited to sit at the counter. A heatwave crashes on our face – being so close to the hot plate is a bliss and a curse.
We choose the most affordable set menu which includes 80 grams of beef.
The atmosphere is casual – the cook is expertly playing with her hera (large spatula) and hagashi (small spatula) while glancing at the Carps playing. 

Watching her work the food on the plate is definitely part of the experience.

We start with 

* fancy appetizer bites

![appetizer]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File135.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* a bone marrow soup

![soup]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File136.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* fried mushrooms and fish

![mushrooms_fish]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File137.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
![mushrooms_fish]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File138.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Andy confirms the fish doesn't taste too strongly and the mushrooms are nothing like we know so it's hard to describe. They are almost meaty in susbtance but the taste is not neither is it mushroomy.
There. A for effort.

Then we are asked to choose between sirloin or tenderloin. 
Andy goes for sirloin, I choose the other. 

She asks us about the cooking. We say "rare", she seems thrown off. 

![bits]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File139.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Anything off a very set script is often very hard and we have no way of knowing what the problem is. Eventually, there is no problem as we are served a beautiful piece each, precut with one slash of her knives for chopstick convenience.

![meat]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File140.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

But of course before that, I try to ask about what the problem is. 
"What's the best way of cooking?" to which the cook points to herself and says "me" with a confused look. That's my cue for the "sorry sorry forget I said anything" gestures. Sumimasen.

My pieces are buttery. They are very very very tender – not one chewy fiber. So when I try Andy's and find his even more tender – I don't understand how this is possible. 

![meat]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File141.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

![meat]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File142.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Once the beef has disappeared, we are served garlic rice, more soup and pickles. Apparently the rice is very garlicky. Tastes pretty normal if you ask me.

![garlic]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File143.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Dessert is a very nice creme brulee with an icecream ball acting more as a mouth refresher, very lightly flavoured.

![dessert]({{site.baseurl}}assets/File144.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Every dish was served very promptly and I probably offended them a bit by photoshooting the whole thing. When we walk out, we are very full and content.

And off to bed.

Andy's highlight: it was just a really wonderful day.
