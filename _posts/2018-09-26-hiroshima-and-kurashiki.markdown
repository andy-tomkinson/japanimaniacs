26/09/2018

We switch our original plans to recharge our batteries before going back to Tokyo.

We had considered a 80km bike ride across the Great Seto bridge connecting multiple islands. 
Instead, we brainstorm and Andy finds a small city with a historical center 1h40 min from Hiroshima. 

We have breakfast at the hotel and it's much much better than in Tokyo. The buffet has a good selection. And a few regrettable typos – especially when it comes to Hiroshima grapes.

Oh yeah, by the by, we have tried natto. The fermented soybeans.
So, for starters, I reckon a breakfast hotel buffet might not be the best place to start.
But after trying, I would not go out of my way to get a nice one - if such a thing exists.

Japanese people apparently have this regularly enough for breakfast that it's an option offered by the hotel.
A hint could be that it comes in a covered pot. You take off the lid and it doesn't smell particularly bad.
When you reach for one, all these strings from the ~~rot~~ fermentation are hanging about.
You chew it, it's fine, then the after-taste hits you.
Imagine trying cheese for the first time at 35. That's what it felt like.
WHAT IS THIS? 

13 days is not enough to get used to it. Grand total of 3 beans eaten by 2 people.

It's clearly new-can o'clock when we get to the station.

The Sakura 10:59 train is chock-a-block. We are standing in a crowded train and decide to switch for a local train before our first intended stop. That's more like it.

We are still not sure about whether the JR pass is worth it. It saves you the hassle of buying tickets but you can't take the express shinkansens and just for using with mostly local trains, it must be a close call. Note we have not used the Shinkansen a lot.

We arrive in the city of Kurashiki.

Walking along the arcade is a very different feeling from say Dotombori.

Reaching the historical center, I trip and with my hand push back up on a wall that cracks under my supernatural strength. It also leaves black on my palm. It's charcoal!
The clay walls have a waterproof layer of charcoal.

The day is very resting. It consists of bench hopping, people gazing, canal strolling.

We are offered a ride on a man pulled chariot (i.e. a rickshaw) which we pass.

We get tickets for some canal punting fun. It's very popular. We have 2 hours + to kill until it's our turn.

We visit a lot of craft shops, get a few souvenirs for our families.

Some people spend the day watercolouring scenes of the center.

The general pace of life is very leisurely and the day is mostly sunny.

At 3pm, we are given a rice hat (or kasa maybe), gestured onto the boat and doki-doki, here we go.

The punters wear Jika-tabi shoes.

Does it present any advantage? Who knows? 
They are a bit like Five-fingers in that you are more connected to the ground.

We meet one dead robot, and a robot determined on teaching us Japanese.

On the train back, we grab a little sweet ball to share. It's so very much packaged. 
Andy thinks it might be because they think we are getting omiyage (or souvenirs for friends or co-workers).
Kind of a big deal here.

![ball](../assets/File172.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

On the platform, we take a picture and the man sat next to us watches us with amusement as we share the snack. Neither of us expects the core to be a grape. It explodes in our mouth and tastes nice.

Back at the hotel, we look for a kaiten sushi place (with the conveyor belt) but have to fall back to a well reviewed and close ramen place. 

The chef is super duper nice. His English is good. 

![ramen](../assets/File173.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We sit at the counter. Andy goes for a curry flavoured mazemen while I go for a hiroshima mazemen.
![ramen](../assets/File174.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
![ramen](../assets/File175.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Mazemen is a dry ramen so there is no broth in our bowls.

The guys sat next to us are intently watching the baseball game. Seems like the carp are playing every single day.

They turn to us and speak English asking where we are from and for confirmation that baseball is not a thing where we are from. It is not. We watch part of the game clueless. It's interrupted by some many ads. The ads show very excited people, the kind of excited we have yet to meet in real life. The guy with the better English says he has been to France 13 years ago and visited Versailles. I have not been to Versailles!

Once they are gone, we chat intermittently with the chef who is busy washing dishes and glancing at the game. 

There are six levels of spicy for our ramens. To get an idea we go for 0.5. I ask the chef "Can you really eat 6?" and admits he can only eat up to 2. Crazy. 

He takes the time to explain the mystery pots on the counter. There is extra chilli available in case 6 is not enough. 

He tells us tonight is the final game of the cup and that the Carp won last year. He shows us a video of people on Hondori celebrating – "1 million!". He uses google translate (we had tried with the awkward waiter - who had almost backed off physically) to tell us that "Behaviour in sake is a lucky item". Free sake is handed to people in celebration!

We both go to the onsen which we both exit at the exact same time. We have to gather all of our will to then head back into town. It's worth it. We catch up with string of supporters of all over the center. They highfive each other shouting "yeeeaaah" or something that sounds like that. They highfive us. The atmosphere is genial.

![fans](../assets/File176.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

One fan drunk on sake takes a picture with one of the stationed policemen awkwardly wriggling his way out of it. 
Andy is brave enough to queue for sake. I will have to wait till a nice lady just hands one to me later on. They are very light but nice. Once a barrel is empty the shout and brandish it over their heads before fetching another one. Someone goes to highfive Andy but stops and asks to try his sake with a "very good".

We never feel threatened at any point. It's celebratory and alcohol-heavy but feels strangely harmless. One businessman carries another one who can barely walk.

We reach the center where a chanting crowd is gathered. On TV, we catch sight of the players being showered with champagne (or some sort of foamy alcohol).

We have had our fun and our fill so we head back to the hotel.

Andy's highlight: A drunken elderly reveller drinking my sake, "very good!".
