27/09/2018

Hopefully this entry will be quite short.

It's transfer day, and we are heading all the way back to Tokyo.

![map](../assets/hiro-tokyo.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

At the best of times, it's long.
We first think we are going to be able to catch a direct shinkansen using the Hikari line.

Once at the station, there is indeed one direct Hiroshima-Tokyo on the Hikari line. At 6 am. Handy.

In the waiting room, we both watch a morning program with morbid fascination.
An older lady is singing with a fake butterfly on her finger with very dramatic stances.
A younger lady bangs her wrist on an instrument at intervals with a very impassive face.
They then switch to sing in a punching ball with the addition of a man.
And end up hosting the show.

A few shinkansens later, we are back in Tokyo.

We are happy to only have quite compact backpacks to travel with.

If you travel with huge suitcases, you're going to run into issues.

1) you can take the stairs (as well as the escalators)

2) your luggage fits in your room.

It's so busy! People are more rude. I had forgotten.

We find our hotel - not the APA chain for the first time in this trip. 

We go past an empty square with a screaming screen advertising amongst others MacBeth Metal and Judas Priest.

Up some very steep and unnecessary stairs. 

Here we are.

The clerk checks us in graciously and hands me some beauty product samples for my skin.
Clearly, there must be something terrible with my skin at this point in the trip.
I keep eyeing up almost in spite of myself the coffee machine in the corner. 
The clerk barely has time to end her welcome with "help yourself to coffee".
I am on it.

Drop bags, shower, we know the drill.

It's night by the time we are ready to go out again. Nighttime means Roppongi.

Following investigation on our first night in Tokyo, it may also mean a walk on the waterfront and the Rainbow Bridge in Odaiba.

Andy navigates us to the food and drink area. You can eat late, you can drink late.
Due to the lack of food on trains, we are famished.

We have no particular place in mind, the avenues spurt out all sort of options from all sort of directions.

I get overwhelmed, we just head down some stairs. 
In Japan, we find it normal by now to consider basements for food venues.

The waitress indicates a table, no sign of warmth passing her eyes, lips or tone at any point.
On the table, a screen awaits us. 
We are served some cabbage as a snack served with some tonkatsu sauce, we are unsure if we are in an izakaya (sort of Japanese pub) or not.

It is a restaurant entirely dedicated to chicken. At least one member of the kitchen staff is not Japanese.
He peers at us curiously from the visible booth. The place is pretty empty.
The smoking area is separated in name only from the rest.
We catch whiffs of tobacco every now and again with a light yet consistent odour backdrop.

We order:
* ginnan seeds - new for us, tasty and dangerous

![ginnan](../assets/File182.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

"When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6)."

* a set of skewers, incidentally (most definitely not intentionally) including a skin-only skewer again
Novelty, we get a cartilage skewer this time and a few offels ones

![skewers](../assets/File179.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* chicken with (never enough) cheese

![chicken](../assets/File180.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

* A drink called "Hoppy" that comes with mixer.
Approximately two seconds later, I have already forgotten the particulars of its taste.

"Hoppy (ホッピー Hoppii) is a beer-flavored almost non-alcoholic drink (0.8% alcohol) [...] mixed with shōchū (a Japanese distilled beverage), it is considered a substitute for beer [...]. The mixed drink is referred to as Hoppy as well. It is still a staple among some Tokyo residents, and has experienced a retro revival of late. It is a popular item at izakaya (Japanese-style pubs)."

The Brewdog in Roppongi has a great selection of Mikkeler.
The fauna is composed of mostly foreigners - tourists and locals.
No ordering at the counter, three staff are staring into space until you hail them decisively.

The flight we share includes three local drafts and thankfully a "Salty kiss".
It's a bit on the pricey side, nothing out of the ordinary for Brewdog though – muses Andy.

I deplore the TV screen on my left hand side which keeps distracting me.
Ticked off, nothing to see, moving on. 

Fed and watered, we take a metro which connects with a JR station. 

We find a book vending machine just because Japan is that much better than us:
![book](../assets/File186.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We hop on a JR line. Everything happens so fast.

Everything except the realisation it's the wrong line.

One stop too late, we retrace our steps to find the right line with the correct destination.

When exiting, the JR line managed by the JR company, the manned booth has a clear crossed-out picture of JR passes and a fee next to it. 

Don't ask.

We have successfully remoleculized at Tokyo Teleport Station.

We exit and are faced with Venus ford a massive mall and what we can assume is the Tokyo Eye?

![steam](../assets/File185.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Further on a wide pedestrian bridge overlooking a blade-runner decor.
Interloping bridges and roads, bridges, punctuated by intensely lit buildings.
![twins](../assets/File187.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Except it's not going towards the waterfront or the Rainbow bridge. Andy feels like this bridge's hard done by.

After playing in a candy-striped art structure, we struggle but eventually find our way to the waterfront promenade. 
![art](../assets/File188.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The water offers a mirror to its crown of skyscrapers. The end of the walk is in sight, what is not is the entrance to the bridge pedestrian path.

The bridge does not present any characteristic of a rainbow. It's just the name that won the competition.
A bit of a let down. Not nearly as much of a let down as the fact it's already closed.
What the online guide meant by walking by night on the bridge was by night before 8:30pm. 
It's over 9pm now.

It's not the end of the world at all, mostly of our nightly walk.
We get closer to the waterfront and investigate the park where there is no direct street lighting and which used to be a fortress.

Pictures of Odaiba waterfront (taken by neither of our professional grade cameras):

Even though, the last metro is around midnight, we don't want to risk missing it as we know taxis are very very very expensive. 

I could not live with the constant pressure when I go out of having to finish the night at a manga cafe or capsule hotel (as if I went out).

We walk at a fast pace and using the closest stop we reach jump on a fully automated and fully crammed line.

A short sweat later, we have also admired the city lights peering through the windows of the speedy car.

At this point, we have no wifi – availability is pretty random – and no paper plan of the metro so we are going entirely by Andy's memory. And it works.

Had I been alone, well, I would have found a way to live in Odaiba by now I guess. I can be pretty resourceful – sometimes and never for directions.

Off to bed.

Andy's highlight: The incomparable Rainbow Bridge
