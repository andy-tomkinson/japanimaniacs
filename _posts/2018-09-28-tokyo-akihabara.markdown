28/09/2018

We decide against having breakfast at the hotel, probably helped by the meh experience we had on arrival.

We have agreed to spend the day in Akihabara.
But ~~noblesse~~ yum-yum oblige, we opt for popping down to Tsukiji market.

![market](../assets/File203.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The guide recommends a few stalls and praises the reasonably low prices of some of these.
Ahem.

![market](../assets/File204.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The market spans over several streets and is packed with people and colours.
It's perfect if you enjoy a good market and don't mind getting stuck in while elbowing people.

![market](../assets/File205.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I marvel at the sights, my head spins from one side to the next while my body tries to avoid every thing that comes its way.
It doesn't smell particularly strong (the smells in Hong Kong will be comparatively intoxicating).

The place offers a multitude of shacks to eat at.
Their price do not seem on the low side relative to the produce being sold.

I cannot resist a juicy oyster:
![oysters](../assets/File207_1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Andy settles for a sweet egg roll, a popular option (everyone is instagramming it instead of eating it):
![egg_roll](../assets/File206.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The market attracts tourists, but some locals are clearly there to buy.
The price difference between say a normal quantity of fresh fish and the mini cups of food sold mainly to tourists is drastic.

We have no intention of visiting the entirety of the market, so we decide to change course and travel to Otakuland ie the dreamland of Akihabara.

We are already looking forward to eating more substantial food for br-unch.
Our first stop is the Gundam Café – 20% of the reason to make Sam jealous.

![gundam](../assets/File208.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The café is filled with all sort of memorabilia related to the multiple Gundam TV series.
You can order lattes topped with characters.

![latte](../assets/File209.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I feel like I need to come out at this point. 
I did not watch Gundam as a kid, I watched a lot of Goldorak (Grendizer) – failing completely to understand the plot.

In France, in the 90s we had this kids program which was mostly broadcasting animes.
Without being aware of it, a whole generation (mine) was thus exposed to Japanese culture and way of seeing the rest of the world.
[If you're wondering what I watched as a kid](https://www.senscritique.com/top/resultats/Le_meilleur_du_Club_Dorothee/188404){:target="_blank"}
Among my favourites were City hunter and Shōkōjo Sara but also many many others.

This place is still awesome, all the opening and ending themes are looping on screen. When I say looping, it's just an assumption.
Because there were a lot of series and the themes are still going on when we leave the place.

The robot used to guard the entrance but it's now safely in display up there - guarding the patrons against the evils of the universe.

Next to Gundam Café, you can find the AKB 48 café. 
![AKB_48](../assets/File211.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Andy patiently explains that Akihabara has its own band of 48 cute girls so named.
48 is a lot to choose from. I can barely remember the names of the musicians I absolutely love.

AKB 48 is actually an idol band, [idol being a well-defined concept in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol){:target="_blank"}
Being seen as role models, any deviation from expectations are symbolically, severely and of course publicly punished.

![Akihabara](../assets/File214.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We have two shops in mind:
 
* Super Potato, a haven for retro games and consoles 
* and Mandrake, a monster building full of toys and mangas.

To access Super Potato, you have to go to the end of a narrow, look-like-nothing kind of hall where you find a lift and an external flight of stairs.

It's 3 levels of narrow aisles, packed with retro goodness. 

I thought it would be hard for me to resist buying a console.

It is hard. 

Andy tries a game on the Virtual Boy console:
![Akihabara](../assets/File217.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

For the record, we both die pretty quickly.

It's fairly hard to take pictures because it's so narrow and dark.
Also mainly because I want to see and touch everything.

I skip about like a 3 year-old and pull Andy's sleeve to show him stuff and he pulls mine to show me stuff.

I play through the first level of Super Mario Bros on a NES and experience a serious bout of nostalgia.

The first two levels are packed with old consoles, games and surprisingly little merchandising.
The top level is an arcade room doubled with a sweetshop where we get the sweets on this picture:
![sweets](../assets/File221.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
2 mini pepperoni (1 has mysteriously disappeared before this shooting), 1 mini cheddar, 1 dry katzu and a yet to be tried last one.


I get to finally meet someone I have played quite a few times (!):
![snake](../assets/File219.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

He seems indifferent – fame.

After eating the pepperoni (I have outed ourselves), we find ourselves peckish.

Akihabara is mostly home to ramens and curries, but on one of its edges we find a small place with locals having a set menu.
Lunch set menus are good value options and the food is very nice!

You can play the game of guessing who eats what:
![Natacha's](../assets/File222.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

![Andy's](../assets/File223.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The carafes are filled with ocha and asking for mizu (water) will only result in an "ocha" response.
We are almost used to it by now. Almost.

The excitement continues with our visit of Mandarake, a complex of 7 or 8 floors dedicated to toys
![Mandarake](../assets/File218.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

All sort of toys, mostly behind glass, mostly collectors.
The sort you do not open and play with in the hope that you might one day resell it (or not).
I would not advise leaving any of these near us as I can vouch for our fortitude.

![toys](../assets/File220.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

We have grown wiser: we start by the top and make our way down and down and down.
Down some never ending glass-protected aisles full of expensive toys, we can only touch with our eyes.

One of the non-Japanese shop assistants is dressed fully as what I can only assume is an anime character –
her long-haired wig flamboyantly pink, her mini skirt blown up by a few petticoats, her stockings high, her white make-up heavy and her smile absent.

Some of the toys are safe with me.
![ugly_toy](../assets/File224.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

One of the floor is dedicated to cosplay and dolls.

~~Build-A-Bear~~ Build-A-Slightly-Creepy-Doll.

Entering one of the floors, Andy meets a lovely – if young – fictional lady.

![Andy_oops_hentai](../assets/File226.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

On this topic, what takes us by surprise in the maze of manga shelves flooding over several floors is the absence of delimitation. 
As in, there is no change in the colours or the atmosphere (I concede probably some curious writings in a language we don't know) and BOOM, hardcore mangas.
Covers depicting things you cannot unsee. 

We are thrilled to discover the subject of girls and panzers is covered.
One less thing to worry about.

![panzers](../assets/File227.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

A whole girl-geared floor is packed with some boys memorabilia and homoerotic fiction.
![boyyyyzzz](../assets/File228.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I almost got this set for the bathroom – scandi-minimalist just like I like.
![boyyyyzzz](../assets/File229.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I beg Andy who holds the camera to take a snap of this as proof that Lovecraft's horror truly is without borders.
![lovecraft](../assets/File230.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I do find the following books to Isabella Bird's series but in Japanese only which is a bit steep.
On this level, the non-Japanese shop assistant is Italian. 

She deftly rings up a gentleman's purchases in Japanese and deals with the next English-speaking couple swiftly.
Her English is very good, and the gentleman does not seem to struggle to understand her in Japanese either.
I am amazed. I also (mentally) comment on the value of knowing languages in the workplace.
Pretty low.

It's immensely rewarding and satisfying on a personal level.
On a professional level, to work that hard to end up as a clerk in a big shop offers little solace.

Regardless, I am impressed.

We are already fed up with trampling but we need more kawaii, more silliness, more of the Japan we think we know.

We head to Don Quijote (shortened to DONKI).
 
The most popular discount store in Japan with pretty much nothing that you can’t find on offer.

This is where we end up buying all the rest of the souvenirs.
Bags of funky-flavoured kitkats, socks, pants, sheet masks.

It's a dangerous place packed with the traces of wild animals.
![paws](../assets/File231.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Sometimes, you can even spot one.
![bear](../assets/File232.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The DONKI store spans over floors and floors and when you think you're at the top, one more escalator, till you reach the maid café and the cigarette-smelling casino-like place.

At this point, our bodies are broken.

Maid cafés are a concept I was not necessarily familiar with before reading about travelling to Japan.
From wikipedia: 
"In these cafés, waitresses dressed in maid costumes act as servants, and treat customers as masters (and mistresses) in a private home, rather than as café patrons."

We have seen maids, here and there, not a lot of them. Some dressed up, others in plain clothes.
They stand in the street and call the passers-by.

I am sure they have plenty of customers but I can only remember one guy actively engaging in a conversation with one of them.
Most people hurry past.

It's not very well accepted to take pictures of them, so we don't.

On a sunny crowded high street, no wind anywhere

Warm smell of ramens, rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance, we saw a shimmering light

Our heads grew heavy and our sight grew dim

We had to stop for a snack.

And what a snack - welcome to the Honey Toast Café Akihabara:
![toast](../assets/File233.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Look at the size of that. 
It's a loaf of toasted bread with icecream on top and if you so wish, whipped cream.

I think it's the first time I am deceived by a picture on a menu in that fashion.
The waiter arrives with our order and my mouth is agape, immediately wondering how in the world we are going to finish it.

"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."

I have yet another surprise in the toilets:
* mouthwash in little disposable cups
* a folding close to the floor plastic lid - any one willing to crack this mystery is welcome to it

this one outside the toilets:
* a good deal of games we know - only in Japanese!

![games](../assets/File234.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Please note, we do not stop to play.
We eat relentlessly, while scrolling through social media to catch up on our friends' lives and cat gifs.
The struggle is real.

I fail to finish my toast – close but no chance – and I regret all the life choices which led me to this moment for the next 6 hours.

![akihabara](../assets/File235.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

One of my goals of the day has not been ticked off.

I would have liked to find a kawaii bag to use as cabin baggage.
It turns out, there is not that many eccentric kawaii goodies to buy around here (even though we find one eventually).
Most bags we come across have insets for custom and changeable plastic posters you find everywhere (and about pretty much everything).

We go out for an ultimate shopping wander, like lost souls, treading about, trying to digest.
As we do, the number of maids in the streets has largely increased (*no precise data available).

One of them go so far as to reach over my stretched arms to hand a leaflet to Andy.
I am actually so tired that Andy is the one who reacts and backs off (a bit).

The last shop we almost fall into is where I find a cute bag.
While I pay, Andy ends up mesmerised by a very disturbing anime on show which he takes pain to describe to me when really, it was unnecessary.

We are done and done. 

Off to bed (without supper - thanks).

Andy's highlight: the Honey Toast is up there and getting my retro on in Super Potato.
