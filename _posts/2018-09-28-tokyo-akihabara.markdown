We decide against having breakfast at the hotel, probably helped by the meh experience we had on arrival.

We have agreed to spend the day in Akihabara.
But ~~noblesse~~ yum-yum oblige, we opt for popping down to Tsukiji market.

The guide recommends a few stalls and praises the reasonably low prices of some of these.
Ahem.

The market spans over several streets and is packed with people and colours.
It's perfect if you enjoy a good market and don't mind getting stuck in while elbowing people.

I marvel at the sights, my head spins from one side to the next while my body tries to avoid every thing that comes its way.
It doesn't smell particularly strong (the smells in Hong Kong will be comparatively intoxicating).

The place offers a multitude of shacks to eat at.
Their price do not seem on the low side relative to the produce being sold.

I cannot resist a juicy oyster:

Andy settles for a sweet egg roll, a popular option (everyone is instagramming it instead of eating it):

The market attracts tourists, but some locals are clearly there to buy.
The price difference between say a normal quantity of fresh fish and the mini cups of food sold mainly to tourists is drastic.

We have no intention of visiting the entirety of the market, so we decide to change course and travel to Otakuland ie the dreamland of Akihabara.
