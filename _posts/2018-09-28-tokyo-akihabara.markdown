28/09/2018

We decide against having breakfast at the hotel, probably helped by the meh experience we had on arrival.

We have agreed to spend the day in Akihabara.
But ~~noblesse~~ yum-yum oblige, we opt for popping down to Tsukiji market.

![market](../assets/File203.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The guide recommends a few stalls and praises the reasonably low prices of some of these.
Ahem.

![market](../assets/File204.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The market spans over several streets and is packed with people and colours.
It's perfect if you enjoy a good market and don't mind getting stuck in while elbowing people.

I marvel at the sights, my head spins from one side to the next while my body tries to avoid every thing that comes its way.
It doesn't smell particularly strong (the smells in Hong Kong will be comparatively intoxicating).

The place offers a multitude of shacks to eat at.
Their price do not seem on the low side relative to the produce being sold.

I cannot resist a juicy oyster:

Andy settles for a sweet egg roll, a popular option (everyone is instagramming it instead of eating it):

The market attracts tourists, but some locals are clearly there to buy.
The price difference between say a normal quantity of fresh fish and the mini cups of food sold mainly to tourists is drastic.

We have no intention of visiting the entirety of the market, so we decide to change course and travel to Otakuland ie the dreamland of Akihabara.

We are already looking forward to eating more substantial food for br-unch.
Our first stop is the Gundam Café – 20% of the reason to make Sam jealous.

The café is filled with all sort of memorabilia related to the multiple Gundam TV series.
You can order lattes topped with characters.

I feel like I need to come out at this point. 
I did not watch Gundam as a kid, I watched a lot of Goldorak (Grendizer) – failing completely to understand the plot.

In France, in the 90s we had this kids program which was mostly broadcasting animes.
Without being aware of it, a whole generation (mine) was thus exposed to Japanese culture and way of seeing the rest of the world.
[If you're wondering what I watched as a kid](https://www.senscritique.com/top/resultats/Le_meilleur_du_Club_Dorothee/188404){target: _blank}
Among my favourites were City hunter and Shōkōjo Sara but also many many others.

This place is still awesome, all the opening and ending themes are looping on screen. When I say looping, it's just an assumption.
Because there were a lot of series and the themes are still going on when we leave the place.

The robot used to guard the entrance but it's now safely in display up there - guarding the patrons against the evils of the universe.

Next to Gundam Café, you can find the AKB 48 café.

Andy patiently explains that Akihabara has its own band of 48 cute girls so named.
48 is a lot to choose from. I can barely remember the names of the musicians I absolutely love.

AKB 48 is actually an idol band, [idol being a well-defined concept in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol){target: _blank}
Being seen as role models, any deviation from expectations are symbolically, severely and of course publicly punished.

We have two shops in mind:
 
* Super Potato, a haven for retro games and consoles 
* and Mandrake, a monster building full of toys and mangas.

To access Super Potato, you have to go to the end of a narrow, look-like-nothing kind of hall where you find a lift and an external flight of stairs.

It's 3 levels of narrow aisles, packed with retro goodness. 

I thought it would be hard for me to resist buying a console.

It is hard. 

Andy tries a game on the Virtual Boy console:

For the record, we both die pretty quickly.

It's fairly hard to take pictures because it's so narrow and dark.
Also mainly because I want to see and touch everything.

I skip about like a 3 year-old and pull Andy's sleeve to show him stuff and he pulls mine to show me stuff.

I play through the first level of Super Mario Bros on a NES and experience a serious bout of nostalgia.

The first two levels are packed with old consoles, games and surprisingly little merchandising.
The top level is an arcade room doubled with a sweetshop where we get the sweets on this picture:
![sweets](../assets/File221.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
2 mini pepperoni (1 has mysteriously disappeared before this shooting), 1 mini cheddar, 1 dry katzu and a yet to be tried last one.


I get to finally meet someone I have played quite a few times (!):
![snake](../assets/File219.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

He seems indifferent – fame.

After eating the pepperoni (I have outed ourselves), we find ourselves peckish.

Akihabara is mostly home to ramens and curries, but on one of its edge we find a small place with locals having a set menu.
Lunch set menus are good value options and the food is very nice!

You can play the game of guessing who eats what:

The carafes are filled with ocha and asking for mizu (water) will only result in an "ocha" response.
We are almost used to it by now. Almost.

The excitement continues with our visit of Mandrake.
