We decide against having breakfast at the hotel, probably helped by the meh experience we had on arrival.

We have agreed to spend the day in Akihabara.
But ~~noblesse~~ miam miam oblige, we opt for popping down to Tsukiji market.

The guide recommends a few stalls and praises the reasonably low prices of some of these.
Ahem.

The market spans over several streets and is packed with people and colours.
If you enjoy a good market and you don't mind getting stuck in and elbowing people.
I marvel at the sights, my head spins from one side to the next while my body tries to avoid every thing that comes its way.
